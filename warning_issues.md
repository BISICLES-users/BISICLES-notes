* **PETSc gives you a warning about the environment variable needing to be the current directory**

This might pop up if you are recompiling BISICLES or already have a PETSc path exported or added to your `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile` or equivalent file. You can fix it by exporting the path again to the directory you are installing PETSc in. 

`export PETSC_DIR=$BISICLES_HOME/[petsc-dir]`

* **You get this warning:**

        None of the TCP networks specified to be included for out-of-band communications
        could be found:

          Value given: ib0,ipoptl

        Please revise the specification and try again.

I think this is something to do with openMPI and is just a warning, if this pops up it means that the code might run a bit slower than it otherwise would but it'll still run. 

* **Parallel HDF5 isn't working due to file locking things:**

        ADIOI_Set_lock:: Function not implemented
        ADIOI_Set_lock:offset 0, length 1
        application called MPI_Abort(MPI_COMM_WORLD, 1) - process 0
        This requires fcntl(2) to be implemented. As of 8/25/2011 it is not. 
        Generic MPICH Message: File locking failed in ADIOI_Set_lock(fd 9,cmd F_SETLKW/7,type F_RDLCK/0,whence 0) 
        with return value FFFFFFFF and errno 26.
        - If the file system is NFS, you need to use NFS version 3, 
        ensure that the lockd daemon is running on all the machines, and mount the directory with the 'noac' option 
        (no attribute caching).
        - If the file system is LUSTRE, ensure that the directory is mounted with the 'flock' option.

On the KNMI HPC, this seems to be due to how the Lustre file system may be mounted and/or only seems to be a problem when compiling with the Intel MPI. I don't really have a solution to this other than to recompile with openMPI if possible. 

* **Error related to LoadBalance.cpp when compiling Chombo on systems with newer GCC compilers:**

  This error might crop up if using a new compiler (especially if using new versions of Fedora or Ubuntu). To fix the issue try the following:

1. Find the file `Chombo/lib/src/BoxTools/LoadBalance.cpp`
2. Open it in a text editor
3. find the line near the top that reads: 
`#include <set>`
4. Add a line below that: 
`#include <limits>`

* Chombo gives this error or similar when compiling:
